<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>Now our application is translated to Russian - thanks to Alexander V. and Alexei A.</p>

<p>You can also teach Stream Media Player to communicate in your native language</p>

<p>Just download the file with original text strings in English from our website (<a href="http://www.psa-mobile.com/android/smp/translate.php">http://www.psa-mobile.com/android/smp/translate.php</a>), add translation into language you want and send it back to us!</p>


<!--
<p>Application is <b>using</b> media <b>codecs installed on the phone</b>, so if some audio / video format <b>is unsupported</b> on some particular phone, <b>Stream Media Player</b> will <b>not</b> be able to <b>play it</b>.</p>
<p>In order to avoid licensing problems, a <b>limited number of codecs is included into Android core</b> (you can look at this list - http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html). Same time, <b>each</b> particular <b>manufacturer can license additional codecs</b> (like WMA / WMV) for its phone. As a result, <b>some phones can play</b> media files encoded with "optional" codecs, while <b>others can't</b>.</p>
